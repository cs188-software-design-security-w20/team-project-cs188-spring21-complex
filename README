Summary:
Project Complex provides UCLA students with a platform to find, rate, and review Westwood apartments. It allows them to make better-informed decisions before signing their leases. It will be functionally similar to bruinwalk.com, but for places to live instead of courses to take. Project Complex was motivated by the lack of resources and transparency that second-year students encounter when hunting for places to live off-campus.

If you haven't already (say you just cloned it): for each of the directories (team complex..., client, server), install the node module dependencies.
  cd [dir_path]
  npm install

Before running the server:
  In /server, create a dotenv file (.env) for connecting to the database. In the .env file, assign the following keys based on your machine/info:
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=s1mpl3
    DB_DATABASE=test

  **** Until everyone has their local sql database setup the same way, MAKE SURE to modify queries for correct table names
  **** Make the sql user password size varchar(100) to store the entire hashed version

Before running the client:

In the terminal (in the root directory), type one of the following (see package.json for more details):
  npm run server
  npm run client 
  npm run dev
