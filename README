Summary:
Project Complex provides UCLA students with a platform to find, rate, and review Westwood apartments. It allows them to make better-informed decisions before signing their leases. It will be functionally similar to bruinwalk.com, but for places to live instead of courses to take. Project Complex was motivated by the lack of resources and transparency that second-year students encounter when hunting for places to live off-campus.

How to use:
  If you haven't already (say you just cloned it): for each of the directories (team complex etc., client, server), install the node module dependencies.
    cd [dir_path]
    npm install

  In /server, create a dotenv file (.env) for connecting to the database. In the .env file, it should say something like:
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=s1mpl3
    DB_DATABASE=test

  In any javascript file where you make database connections, you need to require like so:
    require('dotenv').config()
    process.env.DB_HOST
      This is to access the .env variables

  **** Until everyone has their local sql database setup the same way, MAKE SURE to modify queries
  
  From root dir (pick one):
    npm run server
    npm run client 
    npm run dev
