Summary:
Project Complex provides UCLA students with a platform to find, rate, and review Westwood apartments. It allows them to make better-informed decisions before signing their leases. It will be functionally similar to bruinwalk.com, but for places to live instead of courses to take. Project Complex was motivated by the lack of resources and transparency that second-year students encounter when hunting for places to live off-campus.

If you haven't already (say you just cloned it): for each of the directories (team complex..., client, server), install the node module dependencies.
  cd [dir_path]
  npm install

Before running the server:
  In /server, create a dotenv file (.env) for connecting to the database. In the .env file, assign the following keys based on your machine/info:
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=s1mpl3
    DB_DATABASE=test

  **** Until everyone has their local sql database setup the same way, MAKE SURE to modify queries for correct table names. Note that when accesing the object, the column/attribute name may differ as well. Current implementation depends on the following sql schema:
  apartments
    apartment_id smallint auto increment primary key
    apt_name varchar(40)
    address varchar(40)
    lower_price smallint
    upper_price smallint
    phone char(12)
    email varchar(40)
  reviews
    apartment_id smallint foreign key
    user_id int foreign key 
    bedbath enum ...
    upvotes int default 0
    downvotes int default 0
    review_text mediumtext 
    review_num int primary key auto increment
  users
    user_id int autoincrement primary key
    legal_name varchar(40)
    ucla_id char(9)
    email varchar(40)
    password varchar(100)
      **** size MUST BE varchar(100) to store the entire hashed version (like 70 ? chars)

Before running the client:

In the terminal (in the root directory), type one of the following (see package.json for more details):
  npm run server
  npm run client 
  npm run dev

Current Security Features:
  hashed password stored in db 
  easily restrict access to pages or page content if not logged in
  if user logged in, they can view the profile page

WIP:
  user can only do the following if LOGGED in:
    post reviews
    check their individual profile

TODO:
  sessions, cookies? (if i exit window, or if i'm inactive for some time)
  csrf?
  bruin id check 
  send email verification upon registration
  2FA (forced setup at registration?)
  captcha for posting review
  fine-tuning input validation
